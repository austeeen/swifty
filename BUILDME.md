# Requirements

- g++
- cmake
- [SFML 2.5](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/start-linux.php) or greater

    sudo apt-get install g++ cmake libsfml-dev

if SFML is installed to a "non-standard" path; look at their linux build tutorial for instructions
on how to build.

# Build

if not done already:

    chmod u+x ./run


`run` will create a `build/` directory in the app directory, then run `cmake` and `cmake --build`.

use `run h` for more info and help
