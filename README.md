# Swifty

A game about a cat named Swifty.

Swifty the Game is in development. I do not have big plans for this project but it does serve as a basis for a greater project that I do have big plans for.

## Progress

Currently, this is a very simple 2D platformer. Right now it renders a cat, a spider enemy (AI behavior tree-driven) and a basic level with some moving pieces to jump around on.
